## Facebook Pages Data Scraper


<div style="text-align: justify">
    <br>
In this project, the number of Facebook likes for some of the clubs in the Europe's top 5 leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) are scraped using Selenium. Since the number of Facebook likes is in string format, it is converted to number. Finally, the Plotly Express is used to create a bar graph. The data analysis shows that Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester Unites are the three biggest clubs in terms of number of Facebook likes.
